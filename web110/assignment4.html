	Email, which is short for electronic mail, is an important method of communication in the modern world, which allows people to send messages to each other through the internet. Unlike regular mail, which is physical, email is controlled by email servers. These servers accept, forward, deliver, and store messages, making sure that communication between people is reliable. Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions allows emails to carry text in different kinds of characters and lets you have multimedia content attachments.

	Sending an email includes some steps in a process to make sure it’s sent to the right person. A mail user agent, often known as an email program, sends the message to an email server using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. The server then figures out the destination mail server based on the domain name of the email address and sends the message using SMTP. Once it gets to the destination mail server, the message is delivered to the person’s mailbox and can be read by their MUA using things like POP or IMAP.

	Email messages include various features, including headers that have important information like the date, sender, recipient, subject, and additional recipients. Modern email clients give people the ability to write messages in either regular plain text or with the HTML format. On the backend, email communication uses software programs called mail transfer agents and mail delivery agents to get and deliver messages between hosts. When a message cannot be delivered, the MTA sends a message back to the sender, telling them about the issue. Even though email systems have a lot of different complexities, many people browse their emails through platforms on the internet, which makes the process of sending, receiving, and managing messages a lot more simple.
