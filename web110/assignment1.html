Browsers are software that is used for accessing the internet, for going to websites. Things like social media, youtube, wikipedia, etc, are accessed through browsers. By entering a URL the browser gets information about the website and displays it to you. When you visit a website the browser gets the markup and renders it to you, showing the images, videos, audio, and HTML content. A lot of browsers also have extensions that let you do more with them. They also have stores to be able to find and download these extensions. 

Search engines like google, yahoo, bing, etc are tools that let you search for content on the internet and it's then presented to you as a list. You can also search for images, video, etc. The search engines have algorithms that go through websites and get information from them and save it in their databases. Then when you search they retrieve this information. The most popular browser is Google. They earn money by displaying advertisements that are related to what you're searching. Like if you search for food near where you live there could be ads for local restaurants that paid for the top spot.

HTML is a markup language for creating websites. When you open a website the browser parses the HTML and returns the content that is specified in it. HTML is like instructions that tell the browser what the structure of the page should be, including things like headings, paragraphs, lists, and more. It can also include references to files written in javascript for interactivity, and css for styling the elements that were written in HTML.
