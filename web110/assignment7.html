Computer networks affects me as an aspiring graphic designer. It's not only about producing aesthetically pleasing designs; it's also about how quickly and successfully I can share, work with others, and deliver these designs. Large assets, such high-resolution photos and movies, which are common in graphic design work, may be shared and collaborated on easily across computer networks. This skill is essential, particularly when collaborating with team members and clients who may be dispersed across several geographic regions. I can operate remotely without a powerful desktop computer thanks to networks that provide me access to powerful computing capabilities and storage options. The foundation of data transmission over these networks is the Internet Protocol Suite, or TCP/IP as it is more widely known. Knowing the fundamentals of TCP/IP is important for me as a future graphic designer since it will help me distribute files effectively, interact with clients and team members online, and make use of internet-based resources. The sharing process can be sped up considerably by learning how to optimize file transfers, which is important when there are tight deadlines. Furthermore, maintaining customer confidentiality and safeguarding my work can both be accomplished with a rudimentary understanding of data transfer protocols. The Domain Name System (DNS) is very important, particularly for builders of websites. It converts human-friendly domain names into IP addresses that computers use to identify one another, much like the address book of the internet. Knowing DNS might be the difference between a potential customer finding your work or losing it in the digital abyss for someone managing online portfolios. Having a website is not enough; it also needs to be functional, safe, and accessible. Understanding DNS can help with performance optimization, internet visibility, and identifying common website problems. Despite appearing to be separate from the creative aspects of graphic design, this technical understanding really enhances the functional and aesthetic aspects of my work
