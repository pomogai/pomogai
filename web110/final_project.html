    <p>I now have a thorough understanding of internet web development, covering both the conceptual and technical sides this semester. I now understand the foundational concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are necessary for developing and designing dynamic web sites. The fundamentals of responsive design, which guarantee that web pages are optimized for a range of devices and screen sizes, have been taught in my coursework. In order to create dynamic and data-driven websites, I have also studied backend development, which includes database management and server-side scripting. I've also learned about version control systems, like as Git, which help with code management and collaborative development. All in all, this semester has given me the tools I need to create websites that are practical, aesthetically beautiful, and easy to use.</p>
