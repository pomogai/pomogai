    <p>All my life I have used the google chrome browser because it is the one that I most often see recommended. All my friends and family also use it. I've personally never had any issues with it, but I've heard that it uses a lot of memory which can slow down the computer, especially if there are a lot of different tabs open at the same time.</p>
    <p>I've encountered before internet explorer, because when you first buy a computer it is the default option, although nowadays new computers have both internet explorer and microsoft edge. I just remember that internet explorer feels really slow and old, and some websites don't load correctly when I'm using it. I just open it and right away download chrome.</p>    
    <p>I have safari on my iphone, but I don't use it. This is because in chrome I have my google account and it syncs with all my tabs and history from other devices that I use it on, and safari doesn't do that. Also I've heard that chrome has a lot more customization and extensions available that safari doesn't have. Maybe if I had a macbook I would use safari, because I heard when you have a lot of apple devices safari works well in tandem with them all, but my computer is windows so I don't need that. </p>
    <p>Some of my friends that are gamers have told me to try Opera GX, because apparently it uses a lot less memory than chrome, but honestly I haven't yet ran into issues that would make me want or need to switch to a new browser. I'm used to chrome since I've always used it, I have muscle memory of where all the buttons are and how to operate it, and the integration with google is really useful. My google account also saves my addresses and credit cards so that makes life easier too.</p>
