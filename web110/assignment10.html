    <h1>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Overview</h1>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.</p>
    <p>CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of presentation and content, including aspects such as the layout, colors, and fonts.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Improve content accessibility</li>
        <li>Provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics</li>
        <li>Enable multiple HTML pages to share common formatting</li>
        <li>Reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content</li>
        <li>Present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods</li>
        <li>Display the web page differently depending on the screen size or viewing device</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The CSS specification describes a priority scheme to determine which style rules apply if more than one rule matches against a particular element.</p>
    <p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p>
    <p>A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block.</p>
    <p>Selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.</p>
    <p>Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any elements. An ID may only be applied to a single element.</p>
    <p>A declaration block consists of a list of declarations in braces. Each declaration itself consists of a property, a colon, and a value. If there are multiple declarations in a block, a semi-colon must be inserted to separate each declaration.</p>
    <p>Values may be keywords or numerical values.</p>
    <p>CSS may be specified inline, internal, or external.</p>
