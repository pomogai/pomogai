    <p>Computer graphics are pictures and films created using computers. The development of computer graphics has revolutionized many types of media, including animation, movies, advertising, video games, and graphic design.</p>
    <p>Computer animation is the art of creating moving images via the use of computers. This has opened up new possibilities for visual storytelling and entertainment.</p>
    <p>A raster graphics or bitmap image is a dot matrix data structure representing a rectangular grid of pixels or points of color. Raster graphics are resolution dependent and cannot scale up without loss of quality.</p>
    <p>Vector graphics use polygons to represent images in computer graphics. Vector art is ideal for printing since it is made from mathematical curves and retains crispness even when resized.</p>
    <p>Raster-based image editors, such as Painter, Photoshop, Paint.NET, MS Paint, and GIMP, focus on editing pixels. On the other hand, vector-based image editors, such as Xfig, CorelDRAW, Adobe Illustrator, or Inkscape, focus on editing lines and shapes.</p>
    <p>The &lt;img&gt; element in HTML is used to insert an image into a web page. It requires the src attribute to specify the image URL and the alt attribute to provide alternative text in case the image cannot be displayed.</p>
    <p>Multimedia combines different content forms such as text, audio, images, animations, video, and interactive content. It can be recorded and played on various devices, enabling rich and immersive experiences.</p>
    <p>Streaming media delivers multimedia content in real-time to end-users, allowing them to start playing the content before it has fully downloaded. Live streaming refers to Internet content delivered as events happen.</p>
    <p>Enhanced levels of interactivity in multimedia are achieved by combining multiple forms of media content. This allows for object-oriented and data-driven applications with collaborative end-user innovation and personalization over time.</p>
    <p>In addition to seeing and hearing, haptic technology enables users to feel virtual objects, enhancing the multimedia experience. Emerging technologies may also involve illusions of taste and smell.</p>
    <p>Multimedia can be broadly categorized into linear and non-linear content. Linear content progresses without navigational control, such as cinema presentations, while non-linear content, like video games or self-paced computer-based training, uses interactivity to control progress.</p>
    <p>Multimedia finds applications in various fields including advertisements, art, education, entertainment, engineering, medicine, mathematics, business, scientific research, and spatial-temporal applications.</p>
