	Social media platforms are online tools that let people create, share, and talk to other people online. These platforms, that are called web 2.0 applications, are run on content created by users, where people do things like post pictures and share stories and so on. Users usually have to create profiles on social media websites or apps, which are controlled by the company that runs the platform. These profiles connect users with others, creating online social networks. Some popular social media platforms are Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube, they all have different unique features like sharing pictures/videos, networking, commenting, and messaging.
	Social media has had a really big effect on the way people in the modern time communicate with each other. For content creators, social media gives the chance to do more than just sharing, these creators can build an online reputation and they can even make money from social media, by getting sponsored or from advertisements and views. Social media allows people to talk to many others through a dialogic transmission system, which makes it useful for companies, individual creators , nonprofits, and politicians to communicate with their audiences/fans and communities.
	However social media isn’t just benefits. There are also risks to using it, like cyberbullying, online harassment, and privacy concerns. People can find out information about you like where you live from your pictures, and use this against you. Also, there are now tons of chatbots and artificial intelligence creating and posting content on social media, which makes it difficult to tell who is real and who isn’t. A lot of people warn about these dangers, because it is a loss of privacy, and social media companies own this data about individuals. However despite these problems, social media is still continuing to be a dominant part of people’s lives in 2024, it is a huge part of how people communicate with each other as compared to before when the only options were phone calls or texting. You can find out about what your friends are doing or what’s new in their lives from pictures and other content they share.
