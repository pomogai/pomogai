    The way I got into VoIP is through Skype, Vkontakte, Discord, Google Hangouts, and other platforms. This makes it easy for me to hang out with people remotely play video games or just talk to them. What makes this more convenient is that I can easily work with my team, or discuss my future job in graphic design with the customers remotely, especially for international projects. Thatâ€™s why those tools are going to be very useful in the future.
    Then I learned about screen sharing, and exploring tools like Chrome Remote Desktop and Quick Assist. it's an easy way how to take control of another computer from its screen, almost like magic. This is just impossible to replace the treasure of possibilities for a graphic designer. With these tools, you can edit projects easily in real-time or show your work to clients, removing the need to meet them in real life. It's just if the block of distance has been removed, helping make it more efficient in the creative process. That's why this is an irreplaceable thing in the modern design field of activity
    Last, I have figured out about FTP, which is a way to transfer files very quickly. It's incredibly crucial, especially for large files, making it just perfect for my design projects. With FTP, I'm able to swiftly exchange files with clients or colleagues, enhancing efficiency significantly. It's a game-changer in terms of saving time and reducing stress, as it streamlines the process of handling bulk data. This technology has been a lifesaver, allowing for seamless collaboration and communication in our digital workspace.
    Overall, I learned a lot about some cool tools that are super helpful for someone who does graphic design, which is what I do. These tools make my work a lot easier and quicker. They also let me work with other people in ways I couldn't before. It's like they open up a whole new world of possibilities for creating cool stuff together.
