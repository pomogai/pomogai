    <p>Setting up my browser's privacy and safety settings helped me understand how important it is for a graphic artist to stay safe online. I learned that the only way to control how personal and project-related data is seen and used online is to change the settings on your computer. Which helped me understand how to use Firefox, Safari, and Chrome, along with how to handle cookies, and change private settings. This information is needed to keep track of people's browsing habits and do study online for design ideas or to make sure clients' work is safe from possible cyber threats. I learned how essential it is to be proactive for cybersecurity to protect important design tools via anti-malware software action. Because it can damage files or reveal private information, malware can stop a creator from working. Malware needs to be checked for often in my digital office, especially when I download new fonts or themes. The action also showed how helpful it is to use controlled test files to see how well security software finds malware. This makes sure we can trust the tools we use. I can also tell how well my security measures are working by using test files (like EICAR) to see how well anti-malware software can find malware. This taught me how essential it is to use password management programs and multifactor authentication (MFA) to protect important web account for use of graphic design work. Using and setting up a password manager makes it easier to remember passwords without putting security at risk. Multifactor authentication (MFA) adds another level of safety. If you want to keep access to design tools, client portals, and other important platforms safe, you need to do these things. Some people shouldn't be able to see my work and client info, but I can keep them safe by taking these steps.</p>
