    <p>By using Visual Studio Code and Git in the activities for this lesson, I've greatly improved my web development skills. These are two tools that are important for modern coding and version control. Distributed version control ideas were put to use when I cloned my Bitbucket source and managed files on my local computer. Coding and analyzing HTML pages locally has shown me a lot about HTML's structure and grammar by letting me utilize it direct. Also, checking my HTML pages has made me more focused on a task in order to make less errors and follow web standards. I've learned quick and easy ways to organize and share web content from these exercises, which will help me a lot with my present projects.</p>
