	<p>	A web search engine is a tool made to help people find information on the internet quickly. It works by using software called a web crawler to constantly scan the World Wide Web for new information. This process, called web crawling, lets search engines keep track of real-time information by constantly updating their databases with the newest content available online. Once the crawler collects data from various websites, the search engine indexes this information, connecting words found on web pages with domain names and HTML. This indexing process is essential for search engines to organize and retrieve relevant information in response to user queries.</p>
	<p>	In addition to indexing the web, search engines offer features and parameters to better search results. Users can make use of graphical user interfaces or operators to search and find exactly what they're looking for. Common operators like AND, OR, and NOT help people specify their search queries and improve the results. Most search engines, such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo!, are commercial and make money through advertisements. Some search engines allow advertisers to pay for higher rankings in search results, others show ads with regular search results to make money.</p>
	<p>	Search engine optimization is important in determining a website's visibility in search engine results. It means you have to optimize website content and structure to improve its ranking in unpaid, or "organic," search results. SEO helps websites get more visitors by increasing their visibility and relevance to search engine algorithms. Many search engines better search results based on a user's browsing history and activity. This improves the user experience by providing better and more relevant search results. Overall, search engines, powered by algorithms and AI technology, have changed the way people access information on the internet, making it easier and faster to find stuff online.</p>
